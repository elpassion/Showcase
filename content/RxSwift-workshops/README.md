# RxSwift workshops

The mobile team at **EL Passion** is very enthusiastic about reactive programming. The reactive approach helps us build the apps thinking about the functionalities, not about technical matters of keeping the internal state in sync.

In fact, we use reactive programming so extensively that we'd decided to share the knowledge with others. We've held two editions of RxSwift workshops during which we've mentored almost **40 iOS developers** through their first steps with the framework and reactive programming in general!

## Content

The workshop is aimed towards seasoned iOS developers who have no prior experience with RxSwift. It consists of three modules:

1. Introduction to Functional Reactive Programming and basic RxSwift operators.
2. UI bindings with RxCocoa.
3. Reactive networking.

Each module consists of a theoretical introduction in form of the presentation and a set of the practical exercises focused on implementing the most common tasks in the reactive fashion.
