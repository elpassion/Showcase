SwiftUI it's a new framework desgined by Apple and released in 2019. It's quite new and completely changes the approach to building UI on Apple devices. Compared to predecessors (UIKit, WatchKit, AppKit) you can write code once and use it on every Apple platform, so it's realy time saving for building multiplatform apps. Another big change is the programming paradigm change from imperative to decalrative, so now we are more focused on declaring what we want to receive in result instead of writing in steps how to create something. I'm 100% sure that these changes have a lot of advantages and in the near future applications will be created using SwiftUI, so now it's a very good time to get familiar with and learn how to use it. Below you can see the result of my adventure with SwiftUI.
