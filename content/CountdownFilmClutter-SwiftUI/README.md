After first successful ðŸ˜Ž approach ([FlipClock](https://github.com/elpassion/FlipClock-SwiftUI)) to animations in SwiftUI, I've decided to create the next sample project. Looking for inspiration in the endless Internet, I've found old fashioned countdown film clutter. I realized that it could be challenging to do sth similar in the new Apple UI framework - SwiftUI. Please stop for a moment and take a look at the results of my work.
