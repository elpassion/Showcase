## Having fun(ctions) with Swift

The talk explains what point-free functional programming is. It shows clear benefits of incorporating modular, point-free approach into the iOS codebase and gives practical tips to introduce it in the daily development routine.

The talk showcases the best programming practices that EL Passion iOS team uses in regard to unit testing. It shows how to:

* stub view controllers for unit testing,
* structure the code to be easily testable,
* build views in the test-first approach,
* refactor the test code for readability,
* generate parts of the test code using Sourcery.

## Patterns & practices for unit testing Swiftly

The talk presents the techniques that enabled us to write more testable code  during the development of large Swift codebase. It shows how to make use of snapshot testing, how to apply the boundaries pattern in daily development and also covers the duplicated source code detection.
